## Poemform
Poemform is an interactive bench derived from the waveform
of the poem Diamonds in Dystopia.
Embedded surface transducers so that it becomes a sound system,
the bench will play a different line of poem
depending upon where you sit.

**Team:** Brendan Harmon, Hye Yeon Nam, Anca Matyiku, Vincent Celluci, and Zak Berkowitz.

[Diamonds in Dystopia](#poeform/text/diamonds-in-dystopia.txt):

```
irrigating minds

the one prototype for change
   more giving systems
```
